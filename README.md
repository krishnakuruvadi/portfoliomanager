## Baremetal and Virtual Machine Deployment Method

### 1. Requirements

- Python v3.  Tested with v3.9, v3.10

- Libraries

  - macOS:

```bash
brew install ghostscript tcl-tk
```
  - Ubuntu

```bash
apt install ghostscript python3-tk
```

- Git v2.34.1 or above

  - [Official Git Installation Walkthrough](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

- Virtual Environment (optional)

  - Select and install your preferred virtual environment manager (anaconda, virtualenv, etc.)

### 2. Downloading the application

- Clone or download the source code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krishnakuruvadi/portfoliomanager.git
```

### Prepare the application to launch

- Change into the recently clone/downloaded directory.

```bash
cd ./portfoliomanager
```

- Set git configuration (optional).
```bash
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "youremail@provider.com"
```

- Create a virtual environment (optional).

```bash
python -m venv ./venv
```

- Activate virtual environment.

```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

- Install the required packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Edit the environment variables to suite your needs.

  - Open the env_files directory and edit the .pm-env.sample file.
  - Carefully read the comments throughout the file as it will provide additional context.
  - Edit the parameters as necessary.

- Rename the environment variables file.

  - Remove .sample from the filename. Ensure the filename is .pm-env before proceeding to the next step.
    - **WARNING** - The application is expecting .pm-env as the filename. If you wish to change it please also modify ***env_file_path*** in ***setting.py***

- Delete unused environment variables file (optional)

  - Since the postgresql-env.sample file is only used with docker deployments, this file can be safely deleted before proceeding to the next step.

- Copy or move the entire env_files directory to the src directory. The directory should look as follows:

  - portfoliomanager
    - src
      - env_files
        - .pm-env OR .CUSTOM-FILE-NAME set above.

- Some environment variables are mandatory for certain components to work properly.  For example, forex conversions.  Some environment variables are optional and will only affect optional behavior.  For example, mail client to send portfolio updates

- Setup the server.

```bash
cd src
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic
```

- Create a normal user in django (recommended). Edit the fields below with your desired account details. For more details, please visit [Django's documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/auth/default/#creating-users)

  - It is recommended to use a non-admin account for your daily use and only use an admin account for administrative purposes.

```bash
cd src
python manage.py shell
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
User.objects.create_user('johndoe', 'johndoe@gmail.com', 'johnpassword')
```

- Create a super user in django (optional).

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

  - You should be prompted to enter the desired username, email and password for this new admin.

  - You can create additional normal users by logging in as the superuser and going to: Internals > Admin > Authentication and Authorization > Users > Add User.

- Download, extract, and copy the chromedriver to root of the project (portfoliomanager). You can obtain this driver from here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads. The directory should look as follows:

  - portfoliomanager
    - chromedriver

### Launch PortfolioManager

- Start the server.

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

- Start the huey process

  - In another terminal activate virtual environment (if you created one above) and run background tasks

```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
cd src
python manage.py run_huey
```

### Browse to Portfolio Manager

```
http://<host-ip>:8000/
```

OR

```

Note: Different charts and data gets updated at different fixed schedules.  If you want to manually update these, go to "Internals" and then "Tasks" and queue the tasks to run once

- **Enjoy Portfolio Manager!**

### Prepare the application to launch

- Change into the recently clone/downloaded directory.

### Launch Portfolio Manager

- Within the application folder (i.e. portfoliomanager), run the docker compose file to build the appliaction and launch the docker containers. This step should take approximately *two* minutes.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

- Should you need to tear down the app environment, run:

```bash
docker compose down
```

- Create a normal user in django (recommended). 

  - It is recommended to use a non-admin account for your daily use and only use an admin account for administrative purposes.

  - Edit the fields below with your desired account details. For more details, please visit [Django's documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/auth/default/#creating-users)

  - Your Docker container name may vary. Please adjust the below commads to match your exact setup. In this example, I assume your docker container name running the PorfolioManager app is portfolio-manager-app.

```bash
docker ps
docker exec -it portfolio-manager-app bash
python manage.py shell
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
User.objects.create_user('johndoe', 'johndoe@gmail.com', 'johnpassword')
exit()
```
