def secant_method(tol, f, x0):

    Solve for x where f(x)=0, given starting x0 and tolerance.
    
    Arguments
    ----------
    tol: tolerance as percentage of final result. If two subsequent x values are with tol percent, the function will return.
    f: a function of a single variable
    x0: a starting value of x to begin the solver

    Notes
    ------
    The secant method for finding the zero value of a function uses the following formula to find subsequent values of x. 
    
    x(n+1) = x(n) - f(x(n))*(x(n)-x(n-1))/(f(x(n))-f(x(n-1)))

    This implementation is simple and does not handle cases where there is no solution. Users requiring a more robust version should use scipy package optimize.newton.

    * cashflows: a list object in which each element is a tuple of the form (date, amount), where date is a python datetime.date object and amount is an integer or floating point number. Cash outflows (investments) are represented with negative amounts, and cash inflows (returns) are positive amounts.
    
    Returns
    -------
    * returns a single value which is the NPV of the given cash flows.

    Notes
    ---------------
    * The Net Present Value is the sum of each of cash flows discounted back to the date of the first cash flow. The discounted value of a given cash flow is A/(1+r)**(t-t0), where A is the amount, r is the discout rate, and (t-t0) is the time in years from the date of the first cash flow in the series (t0) to the date of the cash flow being added to the sum (t).
